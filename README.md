# Lung Cancer Classification using Deep Learning

## üöÄ Project Overview
Welcome to the Lung Cancer Classification project using Deep Learning. This repository is dedicated to developing robust deep learning models to classify CT scan images into various types of lung cancer. Utilizing state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this project aims to improve the accuracy of early lung cancer detection, which is critical for effective treatment and patient outcomes.

## üß† Models Utilized
In this project, we explore several advanced CNN architectures known for their efficacy in image classification tasks:
- **VGG19**: Known for its simplicity and depth, which is effective in capturing intricate patterns in image data.
- **ResNet50**: Utilizes residual connections to enable training of deeper neural network architectures without performance degradation.
- **DenseNet201**: Features dense connections between layers to enhance feature propagation and reuse, making it highly efficient.
- **EfficientNetB4**: Balances model scaling across depth, width, and resolution, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy.

## üìä Data Description
The dataset consists of CT scans labeled into the following categories, which represent different types of lung cancer and normal conditions:
- Normal
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma
- Adenocarcinoma
- Large Cell Carcinoma

The data is preprocessed to align image sizes and augment the dataset to ensure robustness and generalizability of the models.

## üîç Main Findings
- **Model Performance**: Each model was rigorously trained and evaluated. Here are the key performance metrics:
  - **VGG19**: Achieved an accuracy of 89.52% on the test set.
  - **ResNet50**: Reached a test accuracy of 72.22%, demonstrating strong generalization.
  - **DenseNet201**: The best-performing model with a test accuracy of 93.33%.
  - **EfficientNetB4**: Performed with an accuracy of 68.75% on the test set.
- **Best Model**: DenseNet201 was finalized as the best model due to its superior accuracy and efficiency in handling complex image classifications.

## üõ† Technologies Used
This project employs various technologies and libraries, primarily focused on Python for data science and machine learning:
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras**: For designing, training, and evaluating deep learning models.
- **NumPy** and **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizing data and model performance metrics.
